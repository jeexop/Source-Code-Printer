## Introduction
Source Code Printer is a tiny utility for converting your source code to a print-friendly document, which generates RTF(RichTextFormat) document as output. Using this tool, you can print out the Whole project's source code on paper in one step.

For C language,call graph of each file and the whole project is generated for source code analysis.

<br/>

**Why print out source code on Paper?**

Because it's too tired to read/review complex long code 
of a small project (about 1,000-3,000 lines of code) on screen for a long time,which drains our eyes. Printing the source code on paper is a good solution! 

Note that it is not designed to replace source code browser, but you can spend most of your time staring at paper, rather than the screen. In this way,it protects your eyesight.
